== Yubikey for LUKS ==

This enables you to use the yubikey as 2FA for LUKS.
The Password you enter is used as challenge for the yubikey

The keyscript allows to boot the machine with either
the password and the Yubikey or with a normal password
from any key slot.

= initialize Yubikey =

Initialize the Yubikey for challenge response in slot 2

	ykpersonalize -2 -ochal-resp -ochal-hmac -ohmac-lt64 -oserial-api-visible

= install package =

Install the package.

= Assign a Yubikey to an LUKS slot =

You can now assign the Yubikey to a slot.
Technically this is done by writing the response to your password (1st factor
knowlege) created by the Yubikey (2nd factor possession) to a key slot.

Admitted - If the attacker was able to phish this response which looks like
this:
	bd438575f4e8df965c80363f8aa6fe1debbe9ea9
it can be used as normal password.
